To read a file’s contents, call f.read(size),
which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode)
or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument.
When size is omitted or negative,
the entire contents of the file will
be read and returned; it’s your problem if the
file is twice as large as your machine’s memory.
Otherwise, at most size bytes are read and returned.
If the end of the file has been reached, f.read()
will return an empty string ('').
